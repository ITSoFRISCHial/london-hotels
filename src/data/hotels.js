It feels like a deeply intentional revival of interwar glamour rather than a themed approximation, with serious architectural credibility and artistic ambition.",
    "tripAdvisorDescription": "Overlooking a tranquil garden square in Mayfair, The Beaumont embodies the spirit of the grand hotels of the 1920s, while surrounding guests with the feel of a private club. The award-winning hotel houses 101 discreetly luxurious rooms and suites, Antony Gormley’s ROOM, an inhabitable work of art and the presidential Roosevelt Suite. The hotel’s chic Art Deco interiors have been refined by leading designer Thierry Despont working with architects Reardon Smith, while its expanding art collection inspires both nostalgia and excitement for the new. Rosi, led by chef Lisa Goodwin-Allen, serves playful twists on beloved British classics, and the Terrace brings al fresco café culture to Brown Hart Gardens. Afternoon Tea is held in The Gatsby Room, while classic cocktails and canapés are served at Le Magritte Bar. The spa offers relaxing and regenerative treatments for guests and locals; and there are three private rooms for meeting and entertaining.",

      "bar": "Café Oscar and the Baptist Grill set within the chapel offer atmospheric, special-purpose evening spaces.",
      "noise": "Interiors feel well insulated; central location is busy but the building's mass helps buffer sound."
